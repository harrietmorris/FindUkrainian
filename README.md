# FindUkrainian

An SPA to locate Ukrainian businesses in Koln, Germany

## Room for improvement:

1. Kind of fixed Google translate widget. The solution is not perfect, and there is no back to original language button.
1. ~~I used this as a quick fix for a translation feature while having troubles with various translation APIs, hid the ugly parts that googleTranslateElement adds to the page with css, put the script loading in a separate js file, and bound the translate func to the button in the Header.jsx. But it stopped working! https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_google_translate.asp~~
1. BusinessDetail Page could use a carousel with images (db has an array of image urls)
1. No media query for mobile yet
1. Reviews and user btn are fake)) Reviews issue can be solved by creating a separate collection in the db for users and reviews, and relate them with ids.
1. User auth would be nice to implement
